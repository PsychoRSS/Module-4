Im going to need a timer and a way to end the game when the time runs out

letters that are rainbow and alternating

A highscore board that can be connected to others

Start button starts the quiz and the timer begins to count down
    A question fades in right as soon as they press start or after a count down

when answering a question then presented with another question

when a question is answered incorrectly time is to be subtracted -4

when all questions are answered the timer sets to 0 and presented with
    a game over screen appears
        where you can put your name/initials   
            then saves score to local storage
